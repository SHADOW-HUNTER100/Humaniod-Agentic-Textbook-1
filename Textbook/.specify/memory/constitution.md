# AI-Native Software Development & Physical AI Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through primary-source verification
All factual claims must be traceable to reliable sources. Every statement of fact must be supported by citations from peer-reviewed articles, academic papers, or reputable primary sources. No secondary sources without verification of the original material.

### Clarity for an academic audience
Content must be accessible to computer science audience with Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level 10–12 readability. Technical concepts should be explained clearly without unnecessary jargon. All terminology must be defined upon first use or in a glossary.

### Reproducibility (all claims must be cited and traceable)
All research findings must be reproducible with proper citations following APA (7th edition) format. Every claim, statistic, and data point must be traceable to its original source. Methodology must be clearly documented to enable replication.

### Rigor (peer-reviewed sources preferred)
Minimum 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed articles from academic journals. Preference for primary research over secondary analysis. All sources must be evaluated for credibility, relevance, and academic rigor.

### Zero plagiarism tolerance
All content must pass plagiarism checks with 0% tolerance before submission. Proper attribution must be given for all ideas, text, and data that are not original. Paraphrasing must still include appropriate citations.

### Academic writing standards
All content must follow APA (7th edition) citation format with embedded citations. Writing must maintain formal academic tone and structure. All figures, tables, and data visualizations must be properly sourced and labeled.

## Key Standards

- All factual claims must be traceable to reliable sources
- Citation format: APA (7th edition) with embedded citations in text
- Minimum sources: 15 total sources
- Source requirements: minimum 50% peer-reviewed articles from academic journals
- Plagiarism policy: 0% tolerance before submission
- Writing clarity: Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level 10–12

## Development Workflow

- Research phase: literature review and source collection with verification (minimum 15 sources, 50% peer-reviewed)
- Writing phase: draft creation following academic standards and citation requirements
- Fact-checking: verification of all claims against original sources
- Citation verification: ensuring all sources are properly cited in APA (7th edition) format
- Plagiarism check: submission to plagiarism detection software
- Peer review: evaluation by academic peers or subject matter experts
- Final review: compliance check with all constitution principles
- Book creation: using Docusaurus with GitHub Pages deployment, Spec-Kit Plus, and Claude Code

## Project Constraints

- Word count: 5,000–7,000 words
- Output format: PDF with embedded citations
- Technology stack: Docusaurus (GitHub Pages deployment), Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code

## Governance

All research and writing must comply with academic integrity standards. Each section must be verified for compliance with citation requirements before acceptance. Any changes to sources or claims must be re-verified against original materials. The constitution supersedes any conflicting practices or guidelines.
