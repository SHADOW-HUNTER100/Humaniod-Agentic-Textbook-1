## Prompt

Lab Architecture Options

Option 1: On-Premise High-Performance Lab
Option 2: Cloud-Native "Ether" Lab

Includes:
- AWS GPU instance costs
- Latency issues
- Sim-to-real deployment workflow

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the "Lab Architecture Options" framework. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering On-Premise Lab, Cloud-Native Lab, and Sim-to-Real Deployment Workflow
- Ten functional requirements addressing both architecture options, cost analysis, latency mitigation, and deployment workflows
- Eight key entities defined (On-Premise Lab, Cloud-Native "Ether" Lab, AWS GPU Instance Costs, Latency Issues, Sim-to-Real Deployment Workflow, Resource Scaling, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Research Continuity)
- Ten measurable success criteria with specific metrics for performance, cost, and workflow efficiency

The specification adheres to academic standards including Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level 10–12 readability and requirements for peer-reviewed sources.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete spec created for lab architecture options
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan or /sp.clarify
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec comprehensively covers both architecture options with measurable outcomes
