# Add Modules to Sidebar and Connect to Homepage Links

## Prompt Text

```
and lastly add modules in sidebar and connect them to the modules links in home page
```

## Response Text

Updated the sidebar configuration to add modules in a dedicated, organized section and ensure connection to homepage links:

1. Created a new "Curriculum Modules" category in the sidebar with explicit module entries:
   - ROS2 Nervous System (specs/3-ros2-nervous-system/spec)
   - Digital Twin Simulation (specs/4-digital-twin-simulation/spec)
   - AI-Robot Brain (specs/5-nvidia-isaac-brain/spec)
   - Vision-Language-Action (specs/6-vla-integration/spec)
   - Humanoid Robotics Development (specs/7-humanoid-robotics-dev/spec)

2. Maintained the "Additional Specs" category with autogenerated content for other specifications

3. Verified that the sidebar paths match the links on the homepage:
   - Homepage module 1 links to /docs/specs/3-ros2-nervous-system/spec
   - Homepage module 2 links to /docs/specs/4-digital-twin-simulation/spec
   - Homepage module 3 links to /docs/specs/5-nvidia-isaac-brain/spec
   - Homepage module 4 links to /docs/specs/6-vla-integration/spec

The modules are now prominently featured in the sidebar under their own category, making them easily accessible to users, while maintaining connection to the homepage module links.

## Outcome

Modules have been added to the sidebar in a dedicated category and are properly connected to homepage links.

## Evaluation

The sidebar now features a dedicated "Curriculum Modules" section that makes the key modules easily accessible. The navigation structure has been improved with clear organization while maintaining the connection between homepage links and sidebar entries.
