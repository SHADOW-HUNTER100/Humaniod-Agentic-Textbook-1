# Manage Spec Files - Two-Step Process

## Prompt Text

```
first step : remove spec file . second step if in my project if spec file needed then add spec or did not add it
```

## Response Text

Completed the two-step process as requested:

**Step 1: Removed spec file**
- Removed the spec.md file from D:\Hackhton 1.3\humaniod-agentic-book\docs\docs\specs\1-ai-native-physical-ai\

**Step 2: Determined if spec file is needed in the project**
- Analyzed the project structure and found this is a Spec-Driven Development project using Spec-Kit Plus methodology
- Identified the presence of .specify directory, multiple spec files for different modules, and related artifacts (plan.md, tasks.md, data-model.md)
- Concluded that spec files are fundamental to the project's methodology
- Added back the spec file since it is needed for the spec-driven development approach

The project follows a specification-driven approach where each feature/module has its own spec file as the foundation for planning and task generation. The spec files are core components of the development methodology and are required for the project to function properly.

## Outcome

Spec file was temporarily removed and then re-added based on the determination that it is needed for the spec-driven development approach used in this project.

## Evaluation

The spec file management was completed according to the project's methodology requirements. The project maintains its spec-driven development structure with all necessary specification files in place.
