# Update Module Links to Correct Documentation Paths

## Prompt Text

```
there is no   module to access its detailed specification, improving navigation and user experience.
```

## Response Text

Updated the module links to use the correct paths that align with the actual documentation structure:

1. Module 1: Robotic Nervous System now links to /docs/specs/3-ros2-nervous-system/spec
2. Module 2: Digital Twin now links to /docs/specs/4-digital-twin-simulation/spec
3. Module 3: AI-Robot Brain now links to /docs/specs/5-nvidia-isaac-brain/spec

These paths are correct based on the file structure where spec.md files exist in the respective directories. The sidebar configuration uses an autogenerated structure for the specs directory:

{
  type: 'category',
  label: 'Specs',
  items: [{ type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'specs' }],
}

This ensures that the spec.md files in the specs subdirectories are automatically included in the documentation structure and will be accessible at the specified paths when the documentation is properly built.

## Outcome

Module links now point to the correct documentation paths that match the actual file structure.

## Evaluation

The module links have been corrected to match the actual documentation structure. The links should now work properly once the documentation site is rebuilt with the updated configuration.
