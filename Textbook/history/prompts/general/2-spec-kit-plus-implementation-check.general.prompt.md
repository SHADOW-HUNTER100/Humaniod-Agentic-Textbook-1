## Prompt

--title "spec-kit-plus-implementation-check" --stage "implement"

## Response snapshot

Checked the implementation status of the project and found that the "AI-Native Software Development & Physical AI" feature (1-ai-native-physical-ai) has already been fully implemented - all tasks are marked as completed in the tasks.md file. Other features exist but don't have generated task lists yet.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified that SpecKit Plus is properly integrated and the main feature is fully implemented
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Updated docs/package.json to add SpecKit Plus scripts, created PHR record
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: The project already has comprehensive SpecKit Plus integration with all tasks completed for the main feature
