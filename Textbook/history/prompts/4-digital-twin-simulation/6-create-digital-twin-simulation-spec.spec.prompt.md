## Prompt

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Focus:
Simulating robots in virtual environments.

Topics:
- Physics simulation with Gazebo
- Unity for high-fidelity visualization
- Sensor simulation: LiDAR, IMU, Depth, Cameras
- Collision, gravity, and rigid-body physics

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the "Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" module. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation
- Ten functional requirements addressing content coverage, readability, citations, and practical exercises
- Eight key entities defined (Digital Twin, Gazebo Physics Engine, Unity Visualization, LiDAR/IMU/Camera Simulation, Physics Parameters, Sensor Fusion)
- Ten measurable success criteria with specific metrics

The specification adheres to academic standards including Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level 10–12 readability and requirements for peer-reviewed sources.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete spec created for digital twin simulation module
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan or /sp.clarify
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec comprehensively covers all required topics with measurable outcomes
