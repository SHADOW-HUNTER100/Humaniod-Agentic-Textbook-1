## Prompt

```text
# Module 5: Humanoid Robotics Development

Topics:
- Kinematics and dynamics of humanoids
- Balance control and bipedal walking
- Manipulation and grasping
- Designing natural human-robot interactions
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the "Module 5: Humanoid Robotics Development" module. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering Kinematics/Dynamics, Balance Control/Bipedal Walking, and Manipulation/Grasping
- Ten functional requirements addressing content coverage, readability, citations, and practical exercises
- Eight key entities defined (Forward/Inverse Kinematics, Dynamic Modeling, Balance Control, Bipedal Walking, Manipulation Planning, Grasping Control, Center of Mass)
- Ten measurable success criteria with specific metrics

The specification adheres to academic standards including Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level 10–12 readability and requirements for peer-reviewed sources.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete spec created for humanoid robotics development module
- 🧪 Tests: Not applicable
- 📁 Files: Created spec.md and requirements checklist
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.plan or /sp.clarify
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec comprehensively covers all required topics with measurable outcomes
