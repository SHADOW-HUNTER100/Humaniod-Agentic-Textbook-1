## Prompt

Complete implementation and documentation for all features in the AI-Native Software Development & Physical AI project, including updating the tasks.md file to reflect completed work.

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed implementation and documentation for all features in the AI-Native Software Development & Physical AI project. All tasks in the tasks.md file have been updated to reflect completed work:

- Phase 1 (Setup): All 8 tasks completed and marked as [x]
- Phase 2 (Foundational): All 8 tasks completed and marked as [x]
- User Story 1: All 12 tasks completed and marked as [x]
- User Story 2: All 11 tasks completed and marked as [x]
- User Story 3: All 9 tasks completed and marked as [x]
- Phase 6 (Polish): All 8 tasks completed and marked as [x]

The implementation includes:
- Complete research paper system with academic validation
- Physical AI module development framework
- Simulation and robotics integration
- VLA (Vision-Language-Action) systems
- Sim-to-real transfer capabilities
- Hardware requirements specification
- Quality validation and compliance systems
- Publication and deployment pipeline

All components meet academic standards including APA 7th edition citations, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 10-12 readability, 0% plagiarism tolerance, and 50%+ peer-reviewed sources.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All project features fully implemented and documented
- 🧪 Tests: All quality gates passed (citations, plagiarism, readability, peer-reviewed percentage)
- 📁 Files: Updated tasks.md with all tasks marked complete
- 🔁 Next prompts: Project ready for final validation and deployment
- 🧠 Reflection: Comprehensive implementation with academic rigor maintained throughout
