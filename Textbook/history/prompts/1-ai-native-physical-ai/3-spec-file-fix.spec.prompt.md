# Spec File Fix for AI-Native Physical AI

## Prompt Text

```
fix the spec file
```

## Response Text

Updated the specification file to address identified issues:

1. Enhanced Edge Cases: The vague edge case descriptions were replaced with specific handling procedures:
   - Source unavailability now has a clear process for alternative suggestions
   - Word count exceedance now specifies flagging and summarization tools
   - Insufficient peer-reviewed sources now includes an exception process with documentation

2. Improved Module List: The module list in FR-007 was reformatted to be more readable with proper bullet points and clear names

These changes make the specification more precise and actionable, addressing the underspecification issues identified in the previous analysis. The specification now provides clearer guidance for implementation and testing.

## Outcome

The spec file has been successfully updated with more specific edge case handling procedures and improved formatting of the module list, making it more precise and actionable for implementation.

## Evaluation

The specification now meets higher quality standards with clearer requirements and specific procedures for handling edge cases, improving the overall clarity and implementability of the feature.
