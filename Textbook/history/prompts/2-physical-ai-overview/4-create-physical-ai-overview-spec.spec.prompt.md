# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Overview

Physical AI focuses on AI systems that operate in the real world and understand physical laws.
This module introduces embodied intelligence, humanoid robots, and the future of AI beyond
digital environments.

Topics:
- What is Physical AI?
- Embodied intelligence principles
- Digital brain → physical body connection
- Why humanoid robots matter
- Applications in real-world environments
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Overview" module. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering Physical AI introduction, embodied intelligence principles, and digital-physical connection
- Ten functional requirements addressing content coverage, readability, citations, and examples
- Five key entities defined (Physical AI System, Embodied Intelligence, Digital-Physical Bridge, Humanoid Robot, Real-World Environment)
- Ten measurable success criteria with specific metrics

The specification adheres to academic standards including Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level 10–12 readability and requirements for peer-reviewed sources.

## Outcome
