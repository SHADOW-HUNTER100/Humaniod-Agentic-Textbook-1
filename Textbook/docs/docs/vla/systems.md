# Vision-Language-Action Systems

## Overview
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems integrate perception, language understanding, and physical action. This module covers the convergence of LLMs with robotics for natural human-robot interaction.

## Key Topics
- Voice-to-action systems with OpenAI Whisper
- Natural language processing for robotics
- Multimodal perception (vision + language)
- Cognitive planning from language to ROS actions
- End-to-end learning for VLA systems

For detailed implementation, see the relevant modules in this documentation.
