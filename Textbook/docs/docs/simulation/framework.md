# Simulation Framework

## Overview
Physics simulation frameworks enable safe and efficient development of robotic systems. This module covers simulation tools like Gazebo and Unity for humanoid robotics development.

## Key Topics
- Physics simulation with Gazebo and Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMU)
- High-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction
- Simulation-to-reality transfer techniques
- Performance optimization for real-time simulation

For detailed implementation, see the relevant modules in this documentation.
