## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Physical AI Introduction (Priority: P1)

Academic researchers and students need to understand the fundamental concepts of Physical AI to build a foundation for more advanced topics. The module must provide clear definitions and explanations of what Physical AI is and how it differs from traditional digital AI systems.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational topic that all other concepts in the module build upon, establishing the core understanding needed for the rest of the module.

**Independent Test**: The module can be tested by verifying that readers can articulate the difference between Physical AI and traditional digital AI systems after completing this section.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader with basic AI knowledge, **When** they complete the "What is Physical AI?" section, **Then** they can clearly define Physical AI and explain its importance
2. **Given** a reader has completed this section, **When** they are asked to compare Physical AI with traditional digital AI, **Then** they can articulate at least 3 key differences

### User Story 2 - Embodied Intelligence Principles (Priority: P2)

Learners need to understand the principles of embodied intelligence that form the theoretical foundation for Physical AI systems. The module must explain how intelligence emerges through interaction with physical environments.

**Why this priority**: Understanding embodied intelligence is crucial for comprehending how Physical AI systems function and why embodiment matters for AI development.

**Independent Test**: The module can be tested by having readers apply embodied intelligence principles to analyze a real-world AI system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a reader studying embodied intelligence, **When** they complete this section, **Then** they can explain how interaction with the environment shapes intelligent behavior
2. **Given** a physical AI system example, **When** a reader applies embodied intelligence principles, **Then** they can identify how the system's physical form influences its behavior

### User Story 3 - Digital Brain → Physical Body Connection (Priority: P3)

Researchers need to understand how AI systems bridge the gap between digital processing and physical action, including the mechanisms that connect AI algorithms to physical robots and their environments.

**Why this priority**: This connection is essential for understanding how Physical AI systems operate in practice, bridging theoretical concepts with practical implementations.

**Independent Test**: The module can be tested by having readers trace the pathway from digital decision-making to physical action in a sample Physical AI system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a description of a Physical AI system, **When** a reader analyzes its digital-physical connection, **Then** they can identify the components that translate digital decisions to physical actions
2. **Given** a problem scenario, **When** a reader designs a digital-physical interface, **Then** they can explain how information flows between the AI and physical components

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are communication delays between the digital brain and physical body?
- How does the system handle sensorimotor conflicts or ambiguous environmental data?
- What if the physical environment changes faster than the AI system can adapt?
