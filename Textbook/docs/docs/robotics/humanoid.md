# Humanoid Robotics

## Overview
Humanoid robotics combines biomechanics, control theory, and AI to create human-like robots. This module covers the fundamentals of humanoid robot design and control.

## Key Topics
- Humanoid robot kinematics and dynamics
- Bipedal locomotion and balance control
- Human-robot interaction principles
- Biomechanical modeling and control
- Applications in service and assistive robotics
