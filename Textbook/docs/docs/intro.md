# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Development Guide

Welcome to the **AI-Native Software Development & Physical AI** research and development project. This documentation guides you through developing embodied AI systems that operate in physical environments with human-like capabilities.

## About This Project

This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical robotics, focusing on creating AI systems that understand and operate within physical laws and environments. Our research covers humanoid robotics, digital twins, vision-language-action systems, and the development of AI-native software workflows for physical systems.

### Key Areas of Focus

- **Physical AI**: AI systems that operate in real-world environments and understand physical laws
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Development of human-like robots with advanced mobility and manipulation capabilities
- **Digital Twins**: High-fidelity simulation environments for training and testing AI systems
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Integrated systems that perceive, understand, and act in physical environments
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Techniques for transferring AI models from simulation to real-world robots

### What You'll Learn

- How to develop AI-native software for physical systems
- ROS 2 integration for robotic systems
- NVIDIA Isaac platform for AI-powered robotics
- Simulation environments for testing and training
- Hardware requirements for Physical AI systems
- Academic research methodologies for robotics

## Getting Started

Begin your journey into Physical AI development by following our structured learning path:

### Prerequisites

- **Gazebo Simulation Implementation**: Create a comprehensive robot simulation environment
- **Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline**: Build an AI-powered perception system using Isaac SDK
- **Capstone: Simulated Humanoid Robot with Conversational AI**: Integrate all components into a complete system

## Recommended Learning Path

1. Review the **[Weekly Breakdown](weekly-breakdown.md)** to understand the complete curriculum structure
2. Study the **[Assessments](assessments.md)** to know evaluation criteria and project requirements
3. Start with **Physical AI Fundamentals** to understand core concepts
4. Move to **ROS 2 Integration** for robotic system development
5. Explore **Simulation & Digital Twins** for virtual environment development
6. Advance to **Humanoid Robotics** for physical robot implementation
7. Master **AI Systems** for perception and action capabilities

## Start Developing

To begin developing with our Physical AI framework:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd humanod-agents-book

# Install dependencies (if using the development environment)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the documentation site locally
cd docs
npm run start
```

The development server will start and serve the documentation at http://localhost:3000/, where you can explore the various components of the Physical AI system.

Continue with the **[Installation Guide](installation.md)** to set up your development environment.
