# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation

## Overview
Physics simulation and environment building with Gazebo and Unity. Simulating sensors like LiDAR and cameras. High-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction.

## Module Structure
This module is organized into the following chapters:

1. [Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Twins](./module-2-digital-twin-simulation/chapter-1-introduction-to-digital-twins.md) - Understanding digital twin concepts
2. [Chapter 2: Gazebo Simulation Environment](./module-2-digital-twin-simulation/chapter-2-gazebo-simulation-environment.md) - Creating physics-based simulations
3. [Chapter 3: Unity Integration](./module-2-digital-twin-simulation/chapter-3-unity-integration.md) - High-fidelity visualization
4. [Chapter 4: Sensor Simulation](./module-2-digital-twin-simulation/chapter-4-sensor-simulation.md) - Simulating various robot sensors

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create and configure digital twin environments
- Implement physics-based simulations using Gazebo
- Integrate Unity for high-fidelity visualization
- Simulate various robot sensors for AI training
