# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview
Middleware for robot control with ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services. Bridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy. Understanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.

## Module Structure
This module is organized into the following chapters:

1. [Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2](./module-1-ros2-nervous-system/chapter-1-introduction-to-ros2.md) - Understanding the fundamental concepts of ROS 2
2. [Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes and Topics](./module-1-ros2-nervous-system/chapter-2-nodes-and-topics.md) - Working with node communication patterns
3. [Chapter 3: ROS 2 Services and Actions](./module-1-ros2-nervous-system/chapter-3-services-and-actions.md) - Synchronous and long-running communication
4. [Chapter 4: AI Agent Integration with ROS 2](./module-1-ros2-nervous-system/chapter-4-ai-agent-integration.md) - Connecting AI agents to robotic systems

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for robotic applications
- Implement different communication patterns (topics, services, actions)
- Connect AI agents to robotic systems using rclpy
- Understand the architecture of ROS 2-based robotic systems

For detailed implementation, see the corresponding chapters in this module.
